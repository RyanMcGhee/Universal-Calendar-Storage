# Universal-Calendar-Storage

I'm only a 3rd year college student in Computer Science, so I want to keep this project not too high maintenance.

Description: A desktop application that has certain options of websites to activate and retreive calendar data from. You turn it on, then type in your profile information. Anytime the websites sends your profile with dates, times, etc., it logs the event into the calindar for a one stop compiled version of all your due dates.

Code Description: I'm doing this mostly for learning and practice, so I am not to sure on the details. The way I'm thinking, I will need to create an oject for each website that I wish the program to be able to access. That object will specifically track and keep up with the imformation coming from that specific source. It will then convert the information needed into a universal calinder object.

Help: I have zero experience with web coding, so I have no idea how to actually retrieve the information. Please leave tips or links to how I can go about figuring this out. Or if my very broad general design above seems off, please leave explanations of how I should start to go about this.
